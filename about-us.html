                        <h2>Tricia Sawyer</h2>
                        <p>My name is Tricia Sawyer and I am currently a student at DeltaV code school, studying
                            software development, which I will graduate in July of 2023. Before that, I was a college
                            student at Kirkwood Community College where I received my associates of Liberal Arts.
                            Software development is something I chose to do right after I graduated, as I took some
                            classes in tech and grew an interest. Along the way, I have gained experience using
                            programming languages such as Javascript, CSS, and HTML and with that, I plan to pursue a
                            career in web development or mobile app creation. Through my educational experience, I have
                            refined my skills in problem solving, collaboration, and time management.</p>

                        <h2>Tim Maupin</h2>
                        <p>Hello, my name is Tim Maupin and before I decided to pursue a career in Software Development I was playing professional rugby in the US and previously in Ireland. The reason that I chose this skill to acquire is because I wanted something that was more sustainable than the job I was going and also less physically demanding. I have also loved playing video games and was even a video game tester in college, so the idea of understanding the back end of development has also been something that I've been limitedly interested in for a while. I would love to work in a environment that is team orientated because I am naturally good working with other people and I enjoy the daily interactions, also it would be really cool and fun to work in a studio that worked on games or shows/movies! The skills I bring is a very long and comprehensive knowledge of front end gaming, I have played games in genres from MOBAs, fps, mmorpgs, argps, rogue-likes, sports games and many more....as I did testing for a handful of games like this before!</p>
